Privacy Policy

Effective Date: June 11, 2025

App Name: Markr

Developer: Daniel Lindquist


Markr (“we”, “our”, “us”) respects your privacy. This policy explains how the app handles your information.

1) Information We Do Not Collect:

Markr does not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal information. Specifically, we do not:

- Collect names, emails, or other identifiers

- Upload your audio recordings or marker data to our servers (we do not operate any)

- Use third-party analytics, ads, or tracking SDKs

2) App Permissions & Purpose:
   
The app may request:

Microphone — to record audio when you choose to record

Storage/Media — to save audio files and markers locally and to open/import files you select

Permissions are used only for these features and can be revoked in your device settings.

3) Local-Only Storage:
   
All audio and markers are stored locally on your device. We don’t have access to this content and don’t retain server copies.

Delete your data: In the app, go to Settings → Clear All Projects, or uninstall the app to remove locally stored data.

4) Network & User-Initiated Transfers:
   
Markr itself does not send your data to any server. However:

If you share a file or marker list, Android’s system share sheet opens and you choose the destination app/service. That third party processes your data under its own policy.

If you open external links (e.g., this privacy policy) or import from cloud storage providers, those services handle any network communication—not Markr.

These actions are user-initiated and do not constitute data collection by us.

5) Children’s Privacy:
   
We don’t knowingly collect data from children. The app functions offline and does not transmit personal data.

6) Changes to This Policy:
   
If we update this policy, we’ll revise the Effective Date above and publish the changes at the same URL.
